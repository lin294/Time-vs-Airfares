### For my project, I’m going to mainly study the data science of the relationship between time and airfares. Specifically, time includes multiple aspects- the day and month of the flight (Year will not be studied because the data only includes airfares in 2019.), the departure and arrival time, the duration of the flights, and the time that tickets are ordered. My figure 1 shows the trend of how ticket price(Economy class only) is related to the day and month of the flight. From my figure, I notice that the ticket price is generally high in March(red points), especailly for day1-15 (the first half of the month). And the ticket price is also high in May(blue), especially for day 18-27(the second half of the month). However, the ticket price is relatively low in April as most of the green points are at the bottom. The price in June (purple) is in the middle. What’s more, for the price of each day, there is no significant difference between the average ticket price, but there is a slight peak at around day 6,9 and 12. Thus, the key point is that flight ticket prices are constantly changing from different days and different months. While there is no obvious pattern, there is evidence showing that tickets for flights at different times, either in different days or months, would have different prices. Overall, from this figure, the best strategy is to buy flight tickets in April.
